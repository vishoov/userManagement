1. Nodemon -> restarting the server whenever there in any change

2. Mongoose -> Mongoose is an ODM -> Object Data Modelling package 

Designing the schemas 
Validating the Data
Error handling the Data
Connecting the mongoDB server to our application

Data errors might happen -> wrong email, wrong phone number, wrong password

connections need to be fast
processing power req should be less



Process 


request -> middlewars --> router -> calls the mongoose -> mongoose validates the Data

-> mongoose sends the data to the database -> a status code is recieved 


4. Error handling

try{ //code here that might cause an error}
catch(err){ //handle the error }


server has to remain live 24x7
